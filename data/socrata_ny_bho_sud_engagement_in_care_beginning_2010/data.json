The metrics emphasize improving rates of timely follow-up treatment post discharge, timely filling of appropriate medication prescriptions post discharge, and reducing rates of readmission.\r\nThe BHO SUD Engagement in Care dataset is designed to assess the frequency with which individuals discharged from inpatient detoxification or chemical dependence inpatient rehabilitation engage in lower level substance use disorder treatment services within 14 and 30 days of discharge. Engagement is defined as receiving two or more such services within 14 days of discharge and three or more lower level services within 30 days of discharge.",
