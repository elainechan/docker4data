  "description": "The data in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator are gathered by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) who obtains information about new stations from trade media, Clean Cities coordinators, the \u2018Add a Station\u2019 form on the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) website, and through collaborating with infrastructure equipment and fuel providers. Existing stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified on an ongoing basis. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database as they are identified. Types of stations include: Private Stations, Biodiesel Stations, Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations, Natural Gas Stations. Stations accommodate either light-duty vehicles only (i.e., passenger vehicles, light-duty pickups, and utility vans), vehicles up to Class 5 (i.e., box trucks and cargo vans), or all vehicle sizes and classes.",
