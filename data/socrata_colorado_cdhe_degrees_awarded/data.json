We perturb some data where the student count is small enough in areas of student achievement where someone could personally identify a student. Usually, counts of 10 or less. \r\n\r\nRow counts are shown per instance. This may lead to student counts being duplicated in some areas where a student is enrolled in multiple institutions or enrolled in multiple degree programs or awarded multiple degrees.",
