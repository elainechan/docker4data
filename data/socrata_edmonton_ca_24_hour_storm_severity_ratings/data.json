  "description": "Rainfall is measured to assess storms and their effects on flooding and sewer performance and design. Rainfall location color icons indicate rainfall totals and maximum storm rating during the past 24 hours. Colors and data are updated every 15 minutes . Higher storm ratings and rainfall totals may have occurred if a storm lasts more than 24h. Storm ratings and rainfall are based on data at the gauge location only - nearby areas may experience differing conditions due to variability of rainstorms. Rainfall is measured between May and October; snowfall is not measured.",
