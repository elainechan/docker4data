Business details include location (with mapping), contact information, hours of operation, restrictions, fees and more. The goal of \"What do I do with...?\" is to reduce the volume of reusable or recyclable items being added to the waste-stream, thereby reducing the environmental impact of those items while extending the lifespan of our landfills.",
