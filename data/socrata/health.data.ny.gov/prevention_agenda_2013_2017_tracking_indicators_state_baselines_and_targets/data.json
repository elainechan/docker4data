  "description": "This dataset consists of 58 state-level health tracking indicators and 31 sub-indicators for the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017: New York State\u2019s Health Improvement Plan.  A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Priority areas include Chronic Disease; Health and Safe Environment; Healthy Women, Infants and Children; Mental Health and Substance Abuse; and HIV, STDs, Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Healthcare Associated Infections.  Along with the name of each indicator are given the baseline year, the baseline year value of the indicator, and the Prevention Agenda 2017 target for the indicator. Sub-indicators are included in this dataset to measure health disparities among racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities.
