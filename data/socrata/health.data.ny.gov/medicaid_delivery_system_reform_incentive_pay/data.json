  "description": "This dataset includes Medicaid clinical metrics for Clinical Improvement Projects (Domain 3) of the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Program. The DSRIP program will promote community-level collaborations and focus on system reform, specifically a goal to achieve a 25 percent reduction in avoidable hospital use over five years. For more information on DSRIP, please see http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/?utm_source=doh&utm_medium=hp-button&utm_campaign=mrt. As a part of the DSRIP program, Performing Provider System will employ multiple projects both to transform health care delivery as well as to address the broad needs of the population that the performing provider system serves. These projects described in Attachment J are grouped into different strategies, such as behavioral health, within each Domain (System Transformation Projects (Domain 2), Clinical Improvement Projects (Domain 3), and Population-wide Projects (Domain 4). For each strategy, there is a set of metrics that the performing provider system will be responsible for if they do any one of the projects within that strategy. This dataset includes only Domain 3 Clinical Metrics. For more information about the measures included in the dataset, check out: http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/docs/strategies_and_metrics_menu.pdf or go to the \"About\" tab.",
