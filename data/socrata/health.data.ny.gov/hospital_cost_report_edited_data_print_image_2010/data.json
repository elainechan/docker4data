Under DOH regulations, (Part 86-1.2), Article 28 hospitals are required to file financial and statistical data with DOH annually. The data filed is part of the ICR and is received electronically through a secured network. This data is used to develop Medicaid rates, assist in the formulation of reimbursement methodologies, and analyze trends. This dataset includes the print image of the edited data.  The ICR is a comprehensive compilation of exhibits that have been modified over time that users should consider when using the ICR dataset. It is possible that data is updated subsequent to posting on this website; therefore the data could become obsolete.
