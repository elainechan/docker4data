  "description": "This data includes the name and location of active food service establishments and the violations that were found at the time of the inspection.  Active food service establishments include only establishments that are currently operating.  This dataset excludes inspections conducted in New York City (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Restaurant-Inspection-Results/4vkw-7nck), Suffolk County (http://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/health/Restaurant/intro.html) and Erie County (http://www.healthspace.com/erieny). Inspections are a \u201csnapshot\u201d in time and are not always reflective of the day-to-day operations and overall condition of an establishment. Occasionally, remediation may not appear until the following month due to the timing of the updates. Update frequencies and availability of historical inspection data may vary from county to county. Some counties provide this information on their own websites and information found there may be updated more frequently. This dataset is refreshed on a monthly basis. The inspection data contained in this dataset was not collected in a manner intended for use as a restaurant grading system, and should not be construed or interpreted as such. Any use of this data to develop a restaurant grading system is not supported or endorsed by the New York State Department of Health. Historical inspection data through 2005 is also available. Inactive (closed) establishments can be found at: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Food-Service-Establishment-Inspections-Beginning-2/aaxz-j6pj.
