The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Each dataset includes tracking indicators for the five Priority Areas of the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017.  The  latest data dataset includes the most recent county level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent county level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2017 state targets for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among socioeconomic groups.
