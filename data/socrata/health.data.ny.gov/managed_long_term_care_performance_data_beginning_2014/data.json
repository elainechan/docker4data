  "description": "The Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC) performance data is a semi-annual evaluation of New York state-certified MLTC plans. Rates are calculated for each performance measure by plan, and describe their population or assess their quality of care. Plans are evaluated on the quality of care they provide and on enrollees\u2019 satisfaction. These data also show the statewide demographic profile of MLTC enrollees and statewide rates of emergency room, hospital, and nursing home utilization. Refer to the Measures document to learn more about specific MLTC measures. In the future, as more evaluations are performed, measures can be trended over time. Refer to the Overview document under the \"About\" tab for information on the data sources, time frames and limitations of this dataset.",
