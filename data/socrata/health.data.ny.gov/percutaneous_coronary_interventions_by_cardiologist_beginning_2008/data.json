  "description": "This dataset contains the number of cases, number of in hospital/30 day deaths, observed, expected and risk- adjusted mortality rates for Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) by cardiologist. Physician information is presented for each physician who a) performed 200 or more procedures during the three year analysis and/or b) performed at least one PCI in each of the three years. The results for physicians not meeting the above criteria are grouped together and reported as \u201cAll others\u201d in the hospital in which the procedures are performed. Regions represent where the hospitals are located.  The initial Health Data NY dataset includes patients discharged between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010. Analyses of risk-adjusted mortality rates and associated risk factors are provided for the three-year period from 2008 through 2010. Analyses of all cases and non-emergency cases (which represent the majority of procedures) are included. Subsequent year reports data will be appended to this dataset.
