  "description": "All acute care hospitals are required to report certain hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH).  This includes central line-associated blood stream infections in intensive care units; surgical site infections following colon, hip replacement/revision, and coronary artery bypass graft; and Clostridium difficile infections. PLEASE NOTE: Because of the complicated nature of the risk-adjustment methodology used to produce the HAI rates, the advice of a statistician is recommended before attempting to manipulate the data.  Hospital-specific risk-adjusted rates cannot simply be combined. In addition, due to NYSDOH validation audits which may involve data from both the current and previous calendar year, a revised data file will be published the year after the original data file was released.  \r\nFor more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/facilities/hospital/hospital_acquired_infections/, or go to the \"About\" tab.",
