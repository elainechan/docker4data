These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. \r\nThe observed rate for Low Birth Weight is presented by resident zip code (including a statewide \r\ntotal).
