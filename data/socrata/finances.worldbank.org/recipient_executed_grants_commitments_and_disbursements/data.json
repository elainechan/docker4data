This dataset provides data on the amount of grant funds committed in the course of a fiscal year and payments made out of a Trust Fund account to eligible recipients, in accordance with the legal agreements.  In fulfilling its responsibilities, the World Bank as Trustee complies with all sanctions applicable to World Bank transactions. Data is provided at the individual Trust Fund level.
