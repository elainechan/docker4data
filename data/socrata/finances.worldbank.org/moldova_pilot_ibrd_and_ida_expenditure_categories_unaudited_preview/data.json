  "description": "This dataset represents the unaudited category schedule activity for the country of Moldova's current IBRD loans and IDA credits and grants. The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.
