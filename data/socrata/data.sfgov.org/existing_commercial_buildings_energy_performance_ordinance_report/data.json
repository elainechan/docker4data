More information: www.sfenvironment.org/ecb This dataset lists compliance status for private-sector (non-municipal) properties where the owner has been notified a building is subject to the ordinance. Fields reported will expand in subsequent releases, and will include energy use intensity, the 1-100 Portfolio Manager rating, and estimated greenhouse gas emissions from annual energy consumption.",
