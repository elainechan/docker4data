  "description": "Since 1996, the Controller's Office has implemented the City Survey, a biennial study of residents' perceptions of the quality of select City services and other community issues.  This cross-year data file includes anonymous responses from survey participants for every year the survey was conducted, as well as a cross-year data dictionary.  The City Survey covers services that are experienced by most residents, including streets and sidewalks, parks and recreation, libraries, public transportation and public safety. It also includes demographic information and questions on community issues such as those related to youth, health and technology. \r\n\r\nFor more information regarding the City Survey, visit http://www.sfcontroller.org/index.aspx?page=406 or contact Celeste Berg at celeste.berg@sfgov,org or (415) 554-5328.",
