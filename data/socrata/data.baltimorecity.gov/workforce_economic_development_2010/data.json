These indicators are grouped into the following\ncategories: labor force participation and employment; educational attainment;\ncommercial investment activity; and businesses and successful small businesses.\nInformation for the City of Baltimore is now available on an annual basis from the American Community Survey (ACS), but community-level information is aggregated over 5-years of data collection. In Vital Signs 10, indicators were calculated\nusing the 5-year average from the 2006-2010 ACS. Business data is purchased from InfoUSA and is available at the address level, which can be aggregated to the CSA level for Vital Signs. It is still important to note that the firm level data from InfoUSA is best to be analyzed at the City level since due to methodology issues,\nindividual level firm data can be problematic to analyze.",
