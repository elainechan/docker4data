The walkway winds under the Michigan and Wabash bridges, providing an uninterrupted route along the river from State Street to the lakefront.\r\n\r\nThe walkway was built out 17-20 feet into the river to create a new shoreline.  Future plans call for extending the Riverwalk to Franklin.  CDOT built the basic infrastructure for the Riverwalk as part of the Wacker Drive reconstruction of 2001-02. From spring to fall, the Riverwalk is home to several restaurants and retail spaces. \r\n\r\nTo view or use these shapefiles, compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS, is required.
