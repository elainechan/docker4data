  "description": "When moisture seeps into pavement, it expands when it freezes and contracts when it thaws.  This flexing of the pavement, combined with the melted water and the stress of vehicular traffic, causes pavement to deteriorate and potholes to form.  The Department of Transportation (CDOT) responds to potholes reported through 311\u2019s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system by mapping open pothole requests each morning and routing crews in geographic clusters so as to fill as many potholes as possible per day.  This metric tracks the average number of days CDOT takes to complete pothole repairs per week.   Total number of requests fulfilled per week is also available by mousing over columns.  The target response time for pothole repairs is within 7 days.
