School vacations influence monthly enrollment, for example, CPS is closed in July. DFSS funds programs providing education and early childhood development activities for children up to 12 years old from low income families. Early childhood services for children age 0 to 5 include free medical, dental and mental health services, and nutritious meals, as well as parent education and training. These programs promote school readiness and child development. For children 6-12, DFSS provides low-income families access to affordable, quality childcare that allows parents to continue to work or participate in approved training programs.",
