The goal of MMRP is to improve conditions, strengthen property values, and create environments supportive of private investment in targeted areas by strategically deploying public and private capital and other tools and resources in well-defined micro-markets. This dataset shows the areas covered by the MMRP program. The data can be viewed on the Chicago Data Portal with a web browser.
