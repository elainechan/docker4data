  "description": "This dataset is a listing of the report status of all residential buildings required to submit a Life Safety Evaluation under city ordinance. Because the Chicago building code has since 1975 required new high-rise residential buildings to be constructed with sprinkler systems, the Life Safety Ordinance mostly impacted high-rise residential buildings constructed prior to 1975.  This dataset does not describe the overall safety of a building, only whether or not the life safety evaluation was submitted and approved by the City of Chicago. Please note that the majority of reports \u201cfailed\u201d initially as a result of a new reporting process and changes to building standards.
