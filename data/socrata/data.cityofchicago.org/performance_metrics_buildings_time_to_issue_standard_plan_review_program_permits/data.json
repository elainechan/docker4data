This metric tracks the average number of days DOB takes to process Standard Plan Review Program building permits, grouped by the week the permit was processed. The target process time is within 53 days. The Standard Plan Review Program is designed for small to mid-sized construction or renovation projects requiring drawings. Eligible projects include buildings up to 80 feet high, institutional or mercantile properties under 100,000 square feet, residential properties of up to 12 units, and foundations no deeper than 12 feet.
