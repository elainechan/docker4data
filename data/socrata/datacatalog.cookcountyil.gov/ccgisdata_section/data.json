If an indigenous people's reserve was present on the tax map, it was digitized to create subpolygons of the half-quarter section, and those polygons were attributed with the name of the reserve. Within this PLSS data set, a half-quarter section is the smallest polygon unit, except in cases where an Indigenous People's Reserve line is present.",
