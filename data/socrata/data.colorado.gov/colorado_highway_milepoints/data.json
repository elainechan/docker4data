  "description": "Colorado Highway, Ramp and Frontage road milepoint locations. Milepoints represent the location along CDOT highways where that highway's linear reference system indicates a whole number reference point (such as 57.000). As such this dataset includes the milepoint description, update year of point, reference points and route id. MIlepoints differ from mileposts in that mileposts are locations of milepost (mile marker) locations alongside CDOT highways collected during GPS mapping efforts in the early 2000s. Therefore, mileposts are not necessarily found at exactly at milepoints.",
