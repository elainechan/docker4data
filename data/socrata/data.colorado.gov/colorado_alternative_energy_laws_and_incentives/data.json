  "description": "The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) maintains a database of state and federal laws and incentives related to alternative fuels and vehicles, air quality, vehicle efficiency, and other transportation-related topics. State-level information is updated annually after each state's legislative session ends. Information for these updates is obtained from state legislative sites when the sites are deemed accurate and timely or by calling specific state offices directly. Federal information is updated after enacted legislation is signed into law or when rules are issued by the responsible agencies. The Alternative Fuels Data Center recommends that users verify with the appropriate state or federal authority that the specific law or incentive is still applicable before making a purchase or tax-related decision.",
