  "description": "The Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT) works to create a positive business climate, encourages dynamic economic development and is focused on building sustainable job growth across the state. We offer a host of programs and services tailored to support business growth at every level including business recruitment, retention and expansion services; business funding and incentive programs; the Colorado Tourism Office; the Colorado Creative Industries office; the Colorado International Trade Office; the Colorado Small Business Development Centers; the Office of Film, Television & Media; minority and women-owned business services and economic analysis and research.\r\n\r\nSince the final draft of the Colorado Blueprint was published in October 2011, OEDIT has executed a strategic plan focused on retention and growth in 14 key industries and aligning those industries across 14 regions throughout the state. The targeted industries represent almost 60 percent of the state\u2019s jobs and an equivalent percentage of the state\u2019s economic output. Our approach is simple: the most efficient and effective means of adding jobs is to drive growth in the industries which are already strong within the state.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to attachment to review the Colorado Blueprint.",
