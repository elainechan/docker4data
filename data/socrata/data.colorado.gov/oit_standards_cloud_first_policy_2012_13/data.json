  "description": "This document lays out the principles and decision criteria for employing \u201ccloud first\u201d services in specific instances and differentiates the different service and delivery models that may be appropriate for different application scenarios. Given the state of the industry, Colorado\u2019s IT infrastructure and footprint, and the opportunities that are available, Colorado is proceeding with a \u201ccloud first\u201d policy, mirroring the Federal government\u2019s cloud policy.  To that end, Colorado is making a deliberate and explicit policy to \u201ccloud first\u201d services. The State will proceed with the presumption that new services, applications and major revisions to existing applications will be supported in a cloud based environment first, unless there are substantive reasons why they should be hosted on the State\u2019s private infrastructure.",
