  "description": "Every six months the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (and prior to 2012, the Federal Reserve System) surveys the terms of credit card plans offered by financial institutions and publishes a report of the findings. The report includes information from the largest credit card issuers in the country as well as other financial institutions that wish to participate in the survey. The credit terms shown in this list are as of January 31, 2012, and are subject to change. You should contact issuers for current rates and to learn about other credit card plans.\r\n\r\nInformation is collected in this survey on Form 2572. The survey was initiated on January 31, 1990; it was discontinued prior to the July 2000 reporting date pursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995. The American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 reinstated the survey, which began again in July 2001.",
