  "description": "In 2006, Seattle voters passed a nine-year, $365 million levy for transportation maintenance and improvements known as Bridging the Gap. The levy is complemented by a commercial parking tax. The levy funds programs to address the maintenance backlog for paving; sidewalk development and repairs; bridge repair, rehabilitation and seismic upgrades; tree pruning and planting; transit enhancements; and other much needed maintenance work. Funding also supports projects that implement the Bicycle and Pedestrian Master plans, create a Safe Routes to School Program, improve transit connections and help neighborhoods get larger projects built through the Neighborhood Street Fund large project program.",
