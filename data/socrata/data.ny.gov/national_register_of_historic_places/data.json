  "description": "The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP) oversees more than 214 state parks and historic sites, encompassing nearly 335,000 acres, that are visited by 60 million people annually. The New York State Historic Preservation Office maintains the list of New York State\u2019s National Register of Historic Places. The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of the Nation's historic places worthy of preservation. Authorized by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 ( Federal Regulation 36 CFR 60 ) the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places is part of a national program to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect America's historic and archeological resources. To be considered eligible, a building, district, structure or object must meet the National Register Criteria for Evaluation. This involves examining the property\u2019s age, integrity, and significance. Please see metadata for additional information, including how to access the agency\u2019s Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS) which provides access to the agency\u2019s database of historic records associated with each project listing in this dataset.",
