  "description": "The Department of Taxation and Finance annually produces a data (study) file and provides a report of statistical information on New York State personal income tax returns that were timely filed. Timely filing means that the tax return was delivered to the Department on or before the due date of the tax return.  The data are from full-year resident, full-year nonresident, and part-year resident returns. This dataset defines individuals filing a resident tax return as full-year residents and individuals filing a nonresident tax return are defined as either a full- year nonresident or a part-year resident.\r\n\r\nData presented in this dataset provide the major income tax structure components by size of income.  The components include income, deductions, dependent exemptions, and tax liability. The data also provides this information by size of income and by the filer\u2019s permanent place of residence (county, state or country).  For a more detailed explanation on the determination of residency and components of income see the attachment: NYSTF_PlaceOfResidence_Introduction.\r\n\r\nResearchers agree to: Use the data for statistical reporting an analysis only.
