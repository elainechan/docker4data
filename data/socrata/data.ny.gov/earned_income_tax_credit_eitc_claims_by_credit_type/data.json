  "description": "The Department of Taxation and Finance annually prepares a mandated report of statistical information on New York State Earned Income Tax credit. Data in this dataset are from Table 3, 5 and 7 of the report. It includes the distribution of credit and average amount of credit by credit type and place of residence. A large proportion of EITC claims are paid out in the form of cash rebates to taxpayers. This is because credit claimants are typically low and moderate-income taxpayers who have little or no pre-credit tax liability. However, in a significant number of cases credit claims are used to offset pre-credit New York State tax liability. In the aggregate, approximately 85 percent of credit claimed is typically returned to taxpayers in the form of cash rebates.
