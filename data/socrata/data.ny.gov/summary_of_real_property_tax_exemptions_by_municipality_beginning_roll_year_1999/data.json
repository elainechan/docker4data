  "description": "The Department of Taxation and Finance annually produces a report pertaining to the exemptions from real property taxation in New York State.  The data analysis includes an examination and summary of exemptions by type or purpose for each municipality in the State.  The summary data include the number of exemptions in each type or purpose, as well as the full value of the exemption amounts.  The types are first broken down into categories of properties that are wholly exempt (and subsequently, not taxable for real property purposes) and those which are partially exempt.  Within those categories, further analysis of the type of ownership of these exempt properties is examined.   Specifically, these types of ownership are public and private.  Additionally, some properties may have exemption codes that are not contained in an agency maintained list of valid codes.  The data file contains a summary by count and full value of these invalidly coded properties, as well.  Finally, properties may have exemptions for various taxation purposes, also stated as taxing jurisdictions.  Those purposes are County, City/Town, and School taxation.  This dataset contains columns with the count and full value for exemptions in each of these taxing jurisdictions.",
