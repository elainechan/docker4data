  "description": "Refer to data dictionary for field name definition. Every year, all parents, all teachers, and students in grades 6 - 12 take the NYC School Survey. The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. New York City parents, teachers, and students reached new participation heights on the 2010 School Survey. 922,694 surveys were submitted.",
