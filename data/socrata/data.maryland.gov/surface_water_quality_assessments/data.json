  "description": "The Integrated Report (IR) combines two water quality reports required under sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act.  Section 305(b) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to perform annual water quality assessments to determine the status of jurisdictional waters.  Section 303(d) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to identify waters assessed as not meeting water quality standards(see Code of Maryland Regulations 26.08.02).  Waters that do not meet standards may require a Total Maximum Daily Load to determine the maximum amount of an impairing substance or pollutant that a particular water body can assimilate and still meet water quality criteria.  Historically, the 303(d) List and the 305(b) report were submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as separate documents but more recent guidance has called for combining these two reports into a single biennial publication.\r\n\r\nMore information is available at http://www.mde.state.md.us/PROGRAMS/WATER/TMDL/INTEGRATED303DREPORTS/Pages/Programs/WaterPrograms/TMDL/Maryland%20303%20dlist/index.aspx\r\n\r\nA searchable version of this data is available at http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs/Water/TMDL/Integrated303dReports/Pages/303d.aspx",
