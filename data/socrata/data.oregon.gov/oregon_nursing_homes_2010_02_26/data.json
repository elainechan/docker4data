  "description": "A nursing home is commonly referred to as a skilled nursing facility, long term care (LTC) facility, or rest home, and may have a different standardized name throughout the United States, but is most commonly referred to as a nursing home. A nursing home traditionally offers 24-hour (skilled) nursing to the elderly or to disabled patients having a variety of medical conditions who require personal care services above that of an assisted living but do not require hospitalization. The personal care services provided may or may not include, but are not limited to: skilled nursing, long term inpatient care, room and board, meals, laundry, and assistance with: dressing, grooming, getting in and out of bed, medications, bathing, and toileting.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of this dataset, an assisted living facility is defined as a facility where the elderly, who are not related to the operator, reside and receive care, treatment, or services. Although not at the level of a nursing home, the services are above the level of an independent living community. They may include several hours per week of supportive care, personal care, or nursing care per resident. Generally, an assisted living facility offers help in daily living (laundry, cooking, cleaning, etc.) and personal assistance (bathing, eating, clothing, etc.). Many assisted living facilities offer assistance with medication and a lesser level of nursing care than what is offered at a nursing home.\r\n\r\nAssisted living facilities may be regulated by size restrictions depending on which type of assisted living facility it is considered to be in the state in which it exists. For example, Adult Family Homes in Wisconsin have between 3-4 elderly residents while Community Based Residential Facilities have 5 or more. Almost every state has different terminology to describe their version of the assisted living facility system.\r\n\r\nThe structures in which assisted living facilities exist are varied as well. Depending on the type, an assisted living facility may operate out of a personal residence or a nursing home style structure, and it may be set up as apartment style living or as a campus setting in a continuing care retirement community. Multiple assisted living facilities may exist at one location or may be co-located with nursing homes and/or other similar health care facilities.\r\n\r\nIf a facility is licensed by a state and holds multiple licenses, it is represented once in this dataset for each license, even if the licenses are for the same location.\r\n\r\nThis dataset does not include retirement communities, adult daycare facilities, or rehabilitation facilities. Nursing Homes that are operated by and co-located with a hospital are also excluded because the locations are included in the hospital dataset.\r\n\r\nFor complete metadata record, please see the OR Geospatial Enterprise Office: http://gis.oregon.gov/DAS/EISPD/GEO/sdlibrary.shtml",
