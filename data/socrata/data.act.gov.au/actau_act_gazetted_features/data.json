Some of these feature names are gazetted, such as streets, divisions, locations etc but not all including but not limited to commercial buildings etc. Feature names are stored in SDMS and maintained in two ways. Names may be maintained though geomedia custom commands. Or they may be maintained though the nomenclature oracle forms as they were prior to SDMS implementation. Feature names are constantly maintained in a effort to have a high data integrity.",
