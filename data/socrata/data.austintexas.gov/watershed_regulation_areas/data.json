The Barton Creek Watershed Ordinance introduced stream set back requirements that created five water quality zones with enumerated development restrictions for each one. The ordinance also provided incentives (increased density) for the transfer of development rights that included the conveyance of land in the critical water quality zone, for water quality protection, to the ped.
