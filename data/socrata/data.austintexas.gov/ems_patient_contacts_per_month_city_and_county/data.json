  "description": "A count of each contact between EMS and a patient during an incident.  A single patient contact is counted for an incident, even if multiple medical staff interact with the patient (e.g. one medic triages a patient and a second medic transports to a hospital).  On the other hand, if an incident involves multiple patients, each contact with those patients is counted once.  For example, a motor vehicle crash with three injured persons would be counted as one incident with three patient contacts. It is single medical interaction between EMS and a patient during the course of an incident. Some incidents may have multiple patients and other incidents may not involve any patients at all.  A patient is a person who requires a medical assessment",
