Many of the indicators were suggested and not completely scoped, and some were aspirational, or not measurable at the time.  The indicators in this list are primarily tracked by other entities, or not deemed as highly relevant and therefore may not receive the same level of analysis as the primary indicators that are available at https://data.austintexas.gov/Government/Draft-Imagine-Austin-Indicators/d7k5-jyb8.
