In May 1994, health care providers were notified of the settlement and the Department outlined reporting requirements, including instructions that information on all procedures from Jan. 1, 1994 on be submitted. However, since only about 1,000 abortion reports were received for the first four months of the year, data for 1994 should be considered incomplete.\nData was last updated on November 5, 2013.",
