Rainfall location color icons indicate rainfall totals and maximum storm rating during the past 24 hours. Colors and data are updated every 15 minutes . Higher storm ratings and rainfall totals may have occurred if a storm lasts more than 24h. Storm ratings and rainfall are based on data at the gauge location only - nearby areas may experience differing conditions due to variability of rainstorms. Rainfall is measured between May and October; snowfall is not measured.",
