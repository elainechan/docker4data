  "description": "Sidewalk trees are notoriously short lived. They grow in difficult environments, but where they are greatly appreciated: high density urban hardscapes. We proposed and executed the Really Grate Tree Project to help us understand how these trees survive and to experiment with methods to improve their growth. Soil data was collected from each tree in both the spring and fall, from 2010 to 2013 at three depths: 0-15cm, 15-30cm, and 30-45cm.\r\nNOTE: Tree 1021501 was completely broken off at ~ 20 cm height sometime near the beginning of 2012 and was replaced with a new elm at that site during the summer of 2012.",
