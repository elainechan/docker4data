For example, Whitemud Drive west of 122 Street encompasses all of Whitemud Drive from west of 122 Street (not including the intersections at 122 Street) to the Terwillegar Drive interchange. Generally, a midblock is defined from one intersection to the next intersection with a public roadway. Midblocks in interchanges are defined by their description in the spreadsheet that follows.",
