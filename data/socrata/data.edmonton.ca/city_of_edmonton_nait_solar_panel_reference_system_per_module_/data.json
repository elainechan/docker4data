  "description": "The reference system consists of six PV modules arranged at fixed angles on the roof of the Shaw Theatre at NAIT\u2019s Main Campus, near the corner of Princess Elizabeth Avenue and 106 Street. The angles correspond to those typically used for solar installations in Edmonton. Each of the six modules is paired with a duplicate module placed at exactly the same angle. During the winter months, snow will be cleared from the left side of the modules. By pairing modules at exactly the same angles, researchers will be able to compare the effect of snow clearing versus snow cover on energy production. The degree angle of rows are 90, 53, 45, 27, 18, 14 degrees. You can find the actual picture at the \"About\" tab. In the dataset column name, 90_LEFT means the left panel and 90 degree angle and so on.\r\n\r\n The City is not the owner of this data, it is provided to us and owned by NAIT",
