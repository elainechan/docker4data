  "description": "Baltimore City continues to make improving the health and lives of its residents a priority. In 2011, the City released the update of Community Health Profiles\r\nfor all CSAs as well as Healthy Baltimore 2015 Safe Homes and Families, a\r\ncomprehensive health policy agenda and measures for tracking progress. In order to describe the health and well being of City residents, BNIA-JFI currently tracks thirteen adult, juvenile, and infant health indicators for Baltimore City and its neighborhoods. The data is provided by the Maryland Department of Health and\r\nMental Hygiene, Maryland Department of the Environment, Baltimore Substance Abuse Systems (BSAS), the Baltimore City Health Department, and the United States Bureau of the Census. Where possible, data is presented at the CSA and C\r\nity level. For several indicators, data is only available at the zip code level.",
