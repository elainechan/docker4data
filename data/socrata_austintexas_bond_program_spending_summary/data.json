The fiscal year begins October 1 and ends September 30.

The following are definitions of terms used in the table. Allocated: The amount of funds designated by the City of Austin Budget Office to be spent per reporting category or proposition. Allocated funds are tied to bond sales, which must be performed in $5,000 increments.
