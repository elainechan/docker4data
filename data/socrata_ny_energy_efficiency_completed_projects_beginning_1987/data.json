  "description": "The Energy Efficiency programs of the New York Power Authority provide energy-efficiency improvements, with no up-front costs, to public schools and other government facilities. From start to finish, the Power Authority works with facility managers to identify, design and install new lighting and motors, as well as upgrades to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. We try to address all energy efficiency improvements in a single, comprehensive effort.  This data set contains information on energy efficiency projects completed since 1987. The data set is updated in a quarterly basis to reflect new data as projects are implemented. The information includes project location, customer name, project name, total cost, and energy efficiency benefits, including energy reduction (electric, natural gas, oil) and greenhouse gas emissions reductions.",
