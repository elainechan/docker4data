  "description": "The Department of Building (DOB) issues building permits to give individuals, insurance companies, neighbors and the City assurance that specific minimum standards are met in constructing, repairing or altering buildings by complying with the Chicago Building Code.

Eligible projects include buildings up to 80 feet high, institutional or mercantile properties under 100,000 square feet, residential properties of up to 12 units, and foundations no deeper than 12 feet.
